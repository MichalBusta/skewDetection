# Efficient Character Skew Rectification in Scene Text Images
The student project for skew detection and rectification.


##Abstract
We present an efficient method for character skew rectification in scene text images. 
The method is based on a novel skew estimators, which exploit intuitive glyph properties and which can be efficiently 
computed in a linear time. The estimators are evaluated on a synthetically generated data 
(including Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Runic scripts) and real scene text images, where the skew rectification 
by the proposed method improves the accuracy of a state-of-the-art scene text recognition pipeline.
